What is this?:

  - Reads the output of npm ls --all
  - Parses the tree
  - Displays it with an interactive UI (like a file explorer: expand and collapse any node)

Known limitations:

  - It crashes if it needs to display more than fits on the screen
    - It would be easy to prevent a crash and just clip the output to what fits on the screen
    - But next we'd want scrolling too -- that would be a more involved change
